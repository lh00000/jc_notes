	<div><h2 id = "1">1. Central Problem of Economics</h2>
	<p>Economics is conserned with the production and consumption of goods and services. Societies face the problems of:<br>
	<b>What goods and services to produce and in what quantities?<br>
	How to produce to them?<br>
	For whom to produce for?</b><br><br>
	These 3 questions arise because of the central economics problems faced by all individualss and all societies - <b>the problem of scarcity</b>, where
	there are insufficient resources to satisfy the unlimited wants of economic agents. Answering these qns entail making choices, and 
	choice results in <b>opportunity cost</b>.
	<br>At the societal lvl, the challenge is to choose in a way that can make the best use of scarce resources, e.g such that welfare is maximised.</p>
	<h3>Scarcity, Choice and Resource Allocation</h3>
		<details style = "padding-left:15px">
			<summary><b>Scarcity</b></summary>
			<p>Happens as resources are limited but human wants are unlimited. Practically all resources are scarce. A resource that is not scarce is called a free good(e.g. sunshine)</p>

			<summary><b>Opportunity cost</b></summary>
			<p>The cost of using resouces for a certain activity, measured in terms of the <b><u>net benefit</u></b> that could be derived from the <b>next best alternative forgone</b>.

	<div><h2 id = "2">2. Price Mechanism and its Application</h2>
	<p>In this chapter, we will considet the workings of the <b>price mechanism</b> in a <b>free market economy</b>. In such an economy, buyers and sellers
	interact freely in the market, with their respective demand and supply decisions affecting the prices of resources, goods and services. These 
	changes in the prices act as signals which provide the information to both buyers and sellers to answer the <b>three basic economic 
	questions</b>. (See in central problem of econs)</p>
	
	<h3>Price Mechanism and Its Functions</h3>
	<details>
		<summary><b>Free Market Economy</b></summary>
		<ul>
			<li>The govt is not involved in resource allocation</li>
			<li>Household and firms are free to pursue their <b>self-interests</b>.</li>
			<li>Households have the freedom of choice to make decisions on what and how much to consume. All FOPs are owned by households and up to them to decide how to use them</li>
			<li>Free enterprise and competition.</li>
			<li>Consumers and firms make their decisions <b>independently</b> of each other. No one person/authority that is planning and directing the economy, 
			yet it moves towards certain goods in certain quantities. This is achieved via <b>price mechanism</b> or the "invisible hand".</li>
		</ul>
		<p><b>Price mechanism</b> refers to coordinating mechanism by which the independent decisions of consumers and producers result in the allocation of scarce resources in a free market economy.</p>

			<summary><b>Demand</b></summary>
			<p>Demand for a good or service refers to the quantity of a good or service that consumers are <b><u>willing and able</u> to buy</b> at various prices, in a given time period.</p>
		</details><br>
		<details style = "padding-left:15px">
			<summary><b>Law of Demand</b></summary>
			<p>The law of demand states that there is an <b>inverse (or negative) relationship between price
			and quantity demanded</b>, ceteris paribus.<br><b><u>Quantity demanded</b></u> of a good refers to the amount a consumer is <b>willing and able</b> to buy
			at a <b><u>given price.</b></u></p>

		<details style = "padding-left:15px">
			<summary><b>Law of Diminishing Utility</b></summary>
			<p>The <b>law of diminishing marginal utility</b> (LDMU) states that beyond a certain level of
				consumption, as more and more units of a good or service are consumed, the

				Assumptions of the law include:
				<br>• The unit of measurement is constant
				<br>• Ceteris paribus condition
				<br><br><b>Total utility</b> is the <b>total</b> satisfaction a person derives from consuming a given amount of
				a good per period of time. It is derived from adding up the marginal utilities of consumption of
				various units of a good.<br><br><b>Marginal Utility</b> (MU) is defined as the <b>additional</b> satisfaction derived from consuming the
				<b>additional</b> unit of the good per period of time.</p>
		</details><br>
		<details style = "padding-left:15px">
			<summary><b>Consumer Decision Making</b></summary>
			<p>Consumers will always attempt to <b>maximise net total utility</b> due to <b>self-interests</b>. Applying <b>marginalist principle</b>,

		<details>
		<summary style = "padding: 15px; border: 2px solid gray; border-radius: 5px; background-color: lightgray;"><b>Concept of National Income</b></summary>
		<p style = "padding-left:15px">
				<b>National income</b> - total income earned by a nation from producing the country's total final output over a given period of time<br>
				<b>National product</b> - value of the total final output of a country over a period of time<br>
				<b>National expenditure</b> - total spending on a country's total output over a period of time<br>
					<details style = "padding-left:15px">
					<summary>The above three concepts are equal in value. Why?</summary>
					<p>National expenditure == national product as the amt of spending on a country's total final output must equal the value of that output<br>
					National income == national expenditure as to produce the national output, the firms employ FOPs which are owned by households.
					In a free market, all FOPs are owned by households who offer their FOP to firms for production in exchange for income.
					Firms pay for these FOPs out of the revenue that they earn from selling the final output(which is == expenditure) will all be paid out as rent, wages, interest and profits to the households.
					Thus national income = national expenditure.</p>
					</details>
					<p style = "padding-left:15px" contentEditable="true">Answer</p>
					<b  style = "padding-left:15px">Approaches</b>
					<ul  style = "padding-left:50px">
					  <li>Output</li>
					  <p>Adds up the <u>value</u> of all <b>final</b> goods and services by every sector of the economy,
					  to give the value of the <b>national output/product</b>. To avoid double counting, only the value of the <b>final output</b> will be added.</p>
					  
					  <li>Expenditure</li>
					  <p>Focuses on expenditure needed to purchase the nation's output. Add up expenditure needed to purchase the national output to get national expenditure.
					  This is obtained by adding up the total spending on domestically produced goods and services by all economic agents, both local and foreign.</p>
					  
					  <li>Income</li>
					  <p>Adds up all the factor income earned by the FOPs too give the value of national income. i.e. wages + rent + interest + profits</p>

				rise in the money value of the goods/services produced in cases of inflation.<br>
				-- When a rise in nominal national income is due mainly to increases in prices, with negligible increase in output and hence consumption, there 
				will be negligible improvement in the material well-being.

				<p>To account for <b>changes in population size</b> over time.<br>
				-- When country's real national income rises faster than the population, it implies that the average income

			<ol>
				<li>Data collection problems</li>
				<p>- Mistakes in data collection due to omissions, double counting or inflation of figures. e.g income tax returns may be inderstated because information provided by taxpayers may be 
				inaccurate or forms may be incomplete.<br>
				- More often in developing countries due to lack of proper accounting systems and expertise of officials, and many inaccessible areas.</p>
				<li>Size of the underground economy</li>
				<p>- <b>Illegal Production</b> e.g. manufacturing and trafficking of harmful drugs, firearms etc<br> 
				-- cause illegal so obv not declared in tax income, and hence omitted from national income<br>
				- <b>Legal activities which are not declared in income tax returns</b> e.g. moonlighting (extra work outside of normal jobs)<br>
				- unrecorded transactions <b>understate</b> the country's national income figures.<br>
				- significant in countries where crimes are pervasive</p>
				<li>Changes in the size of the Non-market Economy(Non-monetary sector)</li>
				<p>- output produced by labour services that <b>do not pass thorugh a market</b> is not counted in the national income stats even when they contribute to total output<br>
				- <b>Home-based/Voluntary Activities</b> e.g. Your mom cook for u, you paint your house urself<br>
				- <b>Subsistence agriculture</b> (ppl grow crops for their own consumption and barter trade)<br> 
				-- could be significant <b>undervaluation</b> of the country's GDP since the output from this sector is excluded from GDP(more often in developing countries)</p>
				<li>Changes in the distribution of national income</li>
				<p>- <b>increase in real GDP may not reflect an increase in income of all residents <u>equally</u> as it reports the <u>average</u></b><br>
				- typical of many rapidly growing countries, resulting in growing inequality<br>
				- <b><u>Use the Gini coefficient as a supplementary indicator</u></b>(Book 4)</p>
				<li>Changes in the composition of national income</li>
