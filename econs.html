	<h2 id = "6">6. Introduction to Macroeconomics</h2>
	<p>In this unit, we study how living standards are measured, with particular focus on using national income to measure and compare living standards over tiem and between countries. We will consider the limitations of doing so and examine whether there are viable alternatives to national income statistics for measuring and comparing living standards.</p>
	<details>
	<summary><b>Standard of Living</b></summary>
	<p><b>Material</b> well-being - stems from the <b>consumption of consumer goods and services</b><br>
	<b>Non-material</b> well-being - refers to aspects of well-being that stems from the <b>intangibles</b> (e.g job satisfaction, amt of leisure time, state of environment...)</p>

	<summary style = "padding: 15px; border: 2px solid gray; border-radius: 5px; background-color: lightgray;"><b>Concept of National Income</b></summary>
	<p style = "padding-left:10px">
            <b>National income</b> - total income earned by a nation from producing the country's total final output over a given period of time<br>
			<b>National product</b> - value of the total final output of a country over a period of time<br>
			<b>National expenditure</b> - total spending on a country's total output over a period of time<br>
				<details style = "padding-left:10px">
				<summary>The above three concepts are equal in value. Why?</summary>
				<p>National expenditure == national product as the amt of spending on a country's total final output must equal the value of that output<br>
				National income == national expenditure as to produce the national output, the firms employ FOPs which are owned by households.
				In a free market, all FOPs are owned by households who offer their FOP to firms for production in exchange for income.
				Firms pay for these FOPs out of the revenue that they earn from selling the final output(which is == expenditure) will all be paid out as rent, wages, interest and profits to the households.
				Thus national income = national expenditure.</p>

				<b  style = "padding-left:10px">Approaches</b>
				<ul  style = "padding-left:50px">
				  <li>Output</li>
				  <p>Adds up the <u>value</u> of all <b>final</b> goods and services by every sector of the economy,
				  to give the value of the <b>national output/product</b>. To avoid double counting, only the value of the <b>final output</b> will be added.</p>
				  <li>Expenditure</li>
				  <p>Focuses on expenditure needed to purchase the nation's output. Add up expenditure needed to purchase the national output to get national expenditure.
				  
				  <li>Income</li>
				</ul>
				<p style = "padding-left:10px; font-size: 12px">Value refers to quantity of a good multiplied by its price</p>
