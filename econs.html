	<div><h2 id = "1">1. Central Problem of Economics</h2>
	<p>Economics is conserned with the production and consumption of goods and services. Societies face the problems of:<br>
	<b>What goods and services to produce and in what quantities?<br>
	How to produce to them?<br>
	For whom to produce for?</b><br><br>
	These 3 questions arise because of the central economics problems faced by all individualss and all societies - <b>the problem of scarcity</b>, where
	there are insufficient resources to satisfy the unlimited wants of economic agents. Answering these qns entail making choices, and 
	choice results in <b>opportunity cost</b>.
	<br>At the societal lvl, the challenge is to choose in a way that can make the best use of scarce resources, e.g such that welfare is maximised.</p>
	<h3>Scarcity, Choice and Resource Allocation</h3>
		<details style = "padding-left:15px">
			<summary><b>Scarcity</b></summary>
			<p>Happens as resources are limited but human wants are unlimited. Practically all resources are scarce. A resource that is not scarce is called a free good(e.g. sunshine)</p>

			<p>The cost of using resouces for a certain activity, measured in terms of the <b><u>net benefit</u></b> that could be derived from the <b>next best alternative forgone</b>.

	<div><h2 id = "2">2. Price Mechanism and its Application</h2>
	<p>In this chapter, we will considet the workings of the <b>price mechanism</b> in a <b>free market economy</b>. In such an economy, buyers and sellers
	interact freely in the market, with their respective demand and supply decisions affecting the prices of resources, goods and services. These 
	changes in the prices act as signals which provide the information to both buyers and sellers to answer the <b>three basic economic 
	questions</b>. (See in central problem of econs)</p>
	
	<h3>Price Mechanism and Its Functions</h3>
	<details>
		<summary><b>Free Market Economy</b></summary>
		<ul>
			<li>The govt is not involved in resource allocation</li>
			<li>Household and firms are free to pursue their <b>self-interests</b>.</li>
			<li>Households have the freedom of choice to make decisions on what and how much to consume. All FOPs are owned by households and up to them to decide how to use them</li>
			<li>Free enterprise and competition.</li>
			<li>Consumers and firms make their decisions <b>independently</b> of each other. No one person/authority that is planning and directing the economy, 
			yet it moves towards certain goods in certain quantities. This is achieved via <b>price mechanism</b> or the "invisible hand".</li>
		</ul>
		<p><b>Price mechanism</b> refers to coordinating mechanism by which the independent decisions of consumers and producers result in the allocation of scarce resources in a free market economy.</p>

		<p style = "padding-left:15px">
		<details style = "padding-left:15px">
			<summary><b>Demand</b></summary>
			<p>Demand for a good or service refers to the quantity of a good or service that consumers are <b><u>willing and able</u> to buy</b> at various prices, in a given time period.</p>
		</details><br>
		<details style = "padding-left:15px">
			<summary><b>Law of Demand</b></summary>
			<p>The law of demand states that there is an <b>inverse (or negative) relationship between price
			and quantity demanded</b>, ceteris paribus.<br><b><u>Quantity demanded</b></u> of a good refers to the amount a consumer is <b>willing and able</b> to buy
			at a <b><u>given price.</b></u></p>

		<p style = "padding-left:15px; font-size: 12px">Ceteris Paribus - all other factors affecting (whatever it is) remain unchanged.</p>
		<details style = "padding-left:15px">
			<summary><b>Law of Diminishing Utility</b></summary>
			<p>The <b>law of diminishing marginal utility</b> (LDMU) states that beyond a certain level of
				consumption, as more and more units of a good or service are consumed, the
				<b>additional utility</b> a consumer derives from successive units decreases.
				Assumptions of the law include:
				<br>• The unit of measurement is constant
				<br>• Ceteris paribus condition
				<br><br><b>Total utility</b> is the <b>total</b> satisfaction a person derives from consuming a given amount of
				a good per period of time. It is derived from adding up the marginal utilities of consumption of
				various units of a good.<br><br><b>Marginal Utility</b> (MU) is defined as the <b>additional</b> satisfaction derived from consuming the
				<b>additional</b> unit of the good per period of time.</p>
		</details><br>
		<details style = "padding-left:15px">
			<summary><b>Consumer Decision Making</b></summary>
			<p>Consumers will always attempt to <b>maximise net total utility</b> due to <b>self-interests</b>. Applying <b>marginalist principle</b>, 
			the <b>rational</b> consumer will be willing to purchase as long as MB>MC. So basically, consumer will keep consuming until <b>MU = P(price)</b>. 
			This is the point of <b>consumer equilibrum</b>. <b>The MU thus reflects the maximum price consumers are willing to pay for an additional
			unit of a good.</b></p>

		<li><details><summary>signaling and incentive</summary>
		<p>he price mechanism performs a signaling and incentive function.<br>
		Price acts as a signal between consumers and producers to allocate scarce resources. Consumers signal to the producers their preference for a particular good or service through the price they are willing and able to pay for it. The higher the consumer’s preference for the good, the higher the price they are willing and able to pay.<br> 
These preferences are transmitted to producers, who have to make production decisions according to their willingness and ability to sell (i.e. supply).<br>
			At the same time, the rise in price is also a signal and incentive for consumers: it signals that energy are now more expensive and is an incentive for them to purchase less energy and Qd falls. <br>
This process continues until quantity demanded = quantity supplied, and the shortage has disappeared. New equilibrium is established at price P’ and quantity Q’.<br>
The price mechanism performs a <b>rationing function</b>. Energy is a scarce resource; the price of energy increases when demand increases. This is a disincentive to some consumers to make the purchase, which rations the energy.

		<details><summary>Tradable Permits*</summary>
		<p>- <b>permits to pollute</b> issued to firms by a govt/international body. Permits can be <b>traded</b> in a market.<br>
		The government first <b>decides on the optimal level of pollution that is allowable</b>. This
aspect makes the policy a command approach. Once the government calculates the total
allowable pollution, the government can either auction the corresponding number of permits
to pollute directly to firms or distribute the permits to firms <b>for free</b>.<br>after this, firms are free to <b>buy and sell the permits, with price decided by demand and supply forces</b>. Firms with high clean-up costs would wish to pollute more than allocated, so they buy perms from firms with low clean-up costs, who would rather pollute less than quota, so they sell the permits to earn revenue. Thus, some
<b>firms are incentivised to find cleaner methods of production to reduce their pollution</b>,
and the <b>overall pollution level is reduced to the total allowable pollution</b> that the
government set.<br>
			They <b>provide incentive</b> to producers to switch to cleaner methods of production, <b>targeting the root cause of the problem,</b> and govt can cntrol amt of pollution.

	<p>In this unit, we study how living standards are measured, with particular focus on using national income to measure and compare living standards over tiem and between countries. We will consider the limitations of doing so and examine whether there are viable alternatives to national income statistics for measuring and comparing living standards.</p>

		<h3>Use of National Income to Measure and Compare SoL</h3>
		<details>
		<summary style = "padding: 15px; border: 2px solid gray; border-radius: 5px; background-color: lightgray;"><b>Concept of National Income</b></summary>
		<p style = "padding-left:15px">
				<b>National income</b> - total income earned by a nation from producing the country's total final output over a given period of time<br>
				<b>National product</b> - value of the total final output of a country over a period of time<br>
				<b>National expenditure</b> - total spending on a country's total output over a period of time<br>
					<details style = "padding-left:15px">
					<summary>The above three concepts are equal in value. Why?</summary>
					<p>National expenditure == national product as the amt of spending on a country's total final output must equal the value of that output<br>
					National income == national expenditure as to produce the national output, the firms employ FOPs which are owned by households.
					In a free market, all FOPs are owned by households who offer their FOP to firms for production in exchange for income.
					Firms pay for these FOPs out of the revenue that they earn from selling the final output(which is == expenditure) will all be paid out as rent, wages, interest and profits to the households.
					Thus national income = national expenditure.</p>
					</details>
					<p style = "padding-left:15px" contentEditable="true">Answer</p>
					<b  style = "padding-left:15px">Approaches</b>
					<ul  style = "padding-left:50px">
					  <li>Output</li>
					  <p>Adds up the <u>value</u> of all <b>final</b> goods and services by every sector of the economy,
					  to give the value of the <b>national output/product</b>. To avoid double counting, only the value of the <b>final output</b> will be added.</p>
					  
					  <li>Expenditure</li>
					  <p>Focuses on expenditure needed to purchase the nation's output. Add up expenditure needed to purchase the national output to get national expenditure.
					  This is obtained by adding up the total spending on domestically produced goods and services by all economic agents, both local and foreign.</p>
					  
					  <li>Income</li>
					  <p>Adds up all the factor income earned by the FOPs too give the value of national income. i.e. wages + rent + interest + profits</p>
					</ul>

				<p>The aggregate income of an economy generated by <b>factors of production owned by residents of a country</b> during a given period of time

			<p style = "padding-left:15px">Real value is a measure of value that takes into consideration changes in prices over time. Besides the concept of real GDP, there are also
			the concepts of real wages, real interest rate etc.<br>
			Since value = price x quantity, when a country's GDP changes over time, it could be due to purely changes in price/quantity or more commonly, a combi of both.
			<br>To find out whether an economy has grown, economists are interested in finding how the <b><u>quantity</u> of final goods and services</b> has changed over time.
			Hence, they use real GDP, which discounts inflation.</p>
			<p style = "padding-left:15px"><b>Aggregate Vs Per Capita values</b><br>

		<summary style = "padding: 15px; border: 2px solid gray; border-radius: 5px; background-color: lightgray;"><b>Comparing a country's SoL over time</b></summary>
		<p style = "padding-left:15px">
			<b><u>National income</u></b> is used to indicate living standards because as a measure of a nation's income level, it reflects the nation's residents'
			<u>ability to consume goods and services</u>. National income is thus fundamental determinant of a country's <b>material aspects of living standards.</b>
			<br><b><u>Real</u> national income <u>per capita</u></b>(real GDP/GNI per capita) is typically used to measure and compare a country's living standard over time.
			<details style = "padding-left:15px">
				<summary><b>Why real?</b></summary>
				<p>To account for <b>changes in the general price level</b> (e.g. inflation)<br>
				-- By valuing a country's final output at constant prices, any increase in value must necessarily be due to a rise in the economy's output,
				and hence reflects the economy's increased ability to satisfy its people's materail needs and wants.<br>
				-- The rise of a country's well-being over time is dependent on the rise of the quantity of goods and services produced, rather than a mere
				rise in the money value of the goods/services produced in cases of inflation.<br>
				-- When a rise in nominal national income is due mainly to increases in prices, with negligible increase in output and hence consumption, there 
				will be negligible improvement in the material well-being.								
				</p>
			</details><br>
			<details style = "padding-left:15px">
				<summary><b>Why per capita?</b></summary>
				<p>To account for <b>changes in population size</b> over time.<br>
				-- When country's real national income rises faster than the population, it implies that the average income
				per person and thus lvl of consumption of goods and services, has increase, leading to an improvement in material well-being over time.
				</p>
			</details>
			<h4 style = "padding-left:15px">Limitations of using real naitonal income per capita to compare SoL over time</h4>
			<ol>
				<li>Data collection problems</li>
				<p>- Mistakes in data collection due to omissions, double counting or inflation of figures. e.g income tax returns may be inderstated because information provided by taxpayers may be 
				inaccurate or forms may be incomplete.<br>
				- More often in developing countries due to lack of proper accounting systems and expertise of officials, and many inaccessible areas.</p>
				<li>Size of the underground economy</li>
				<p>- <b>Illegal Production</b> e.g. manufacturing and trafficking of harmful drugs, firearms etc<br> 
				-- cause illegal so obv not declared in tax income, and hence omitted from national income<br>
				- <b>Legal activities which are not declared in income tax returns</b> e.g. moonlighting (extra work outside of normal jobs)<br>
				- unrecorded transactions <b>understate</b> the country's national income figures.<br>
				- significant in countries where crimes are pervasive</p>
				<li>Changes in the size of the Non-market Economy(Non-monetary sector)</li>
				<p>- output produced by labour services that <b>do not pass thorugh a market</b> is not counted in the national income stats even when they contribute to total output<br>
				- <b>Home-based/Voluntary Activities</b> e.g. Your mom cook for u, you paint your house urself<br>
				- <b>Subsistence agriculture</b> (ppl grow crops for their own consumption and barter trade)<br> 
				-- could be significant <b>undervaluation</b> of the country's GDP since the output from this sector is excluded from GDP(more often in developing countries)</p>
				<li>Changes in the distribution of national income</li>
				<p>- <b>increase in real GDP may not reflect an increase in income of all residents <u>equally</u> as it reports the <u>average</u></b><br>
				- typical of many rapidly growing countries, resulting in growing inequality<br>
				- <b><u>Use the Gini coefficient as a supplementary indicator</u></b>(Book 4)</p>
				<li>Changes in the composition of national income</li>
